Requirements:
 - Java 7 or 8 (see STEP 1)
 - Python 2.7 with h5py module (see STEP 2)


STEP 0:
If you installed a too recent version of Java (9, 10, etc.), foxtrot might not work properly, and you will have to uninstall Java first.
Since Java 9, a lot of things changed in Java, and backward compatibility is no more fully assured.
This is why you might need to uninstall too recent versions of Java.
To do so, you will have to follow instructions detailed at these pages (follow both instructions):
- Uninstall Java/JRE: https://www.java.com/en/download/help/mac_uninstall_java.xml (section "Uninstall Oracle Java using the Terminal")
- Uninstall Java/JDK: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/mac_jdk.html#A1096903 (section "Uninstalling the JDK")


STEP 1:
Download and install Java JDK 7 or 8 (not JRE) from Oracle website.
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html


STEP 1:
In order to have the python extractor working:
Install Anaconda (python 2.7) as suggested here: http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/build.html


STEP 2:
Please, make sure that foxtrot.command, extractor.sh (located in python folder), and any ".command" file in resources/tools folder, are executable.
If that's not the case: chmod +x <filename>


STEP 3:
-> Launch foxtrot.command
