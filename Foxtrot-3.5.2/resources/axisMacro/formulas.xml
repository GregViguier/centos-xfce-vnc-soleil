	USAGE OF THIS FILE:
	
	This file contains the formulas that will be used in the Foxtrot and ImageReducer Charts.
	Its usage is simple. The formulas must be contained within a the "root" tag (i.e between <root> and </root>).
	Each formula is delimited by the <formula> tag. This tag has only one attribute, the "name" attribute. This name
	will be used to be displayed in the combo-box that allows the user to selected which transformation he wants to apply
	to the curves.
	
	Within the <formula> tag, there must be at least 2 <value> tag:
		- One for the transformation of the abscissa.
		- One for the transformation of the ordinate.
	There is only one attribute possible for the <value> tag, which is the "id" attribute. There are, for this attribute, 
	only 2 possible values which are "X" or "Y" (in capital letters). This attribute will set if the formula contained between 
	the <value> tag stands for, respectively, the abscissa or the ordinate.
	Within the <value> tags, any mathematical formula can be used. For further information about the syntax, please refer to the 
	expression evaluation help provided in the chart when right clicking on it then selecting the "Evaluate an expression" item in 
	the pop-up menu.
	In this expression, "X" refers to the abscissa, and "Y" refers to the ordinate. It is possible to use variables (or parameters) 
	obtained from Fits. To use them, simply put the parameter name you want to use in the formula EXACTLY AS IT IS WRITTEN (it is case sensitive)
	in the "Fit Result Params" view of Foxtrot or Image Reducer (in the table header). The used parameters have to be declared in the formula within
	<parameter> tags.
	
	The <parameter> tags have no attributes, just a value. This value must be the name of the parameter used in the Fit with EXACTLY THE SAME CASE as it
	is displayed in the table header.
	
	Finally, an example of an implementation of this file with the "Renormalized Kratky plot" which formula is "Y*X*X*Rg*Rg/I0_ VERSUS X*Rg" (the logic used here is
	Y VERSUS X for a normal outline with no data transformation). To use this example, you just have to uncomment the formula.
